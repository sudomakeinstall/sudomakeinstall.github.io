# Cardiovascular Procedure Eponyms

## Aortic Root Surgery

- **Bentall Procedure** — Composite aortic root replacement with a valved conduit (mechanical or bioprosthetic) and coronary reimplantation. Standard approach for aortic root aneurysm with aortic valve disease.
- **David Procedure** — Valve-sparing aortic root replacement. The native aortic valve is reimplanted inside a synthetic graft, preserving the patient's own valve while replacing the dilated root.
- **Yacoub Procedure** — Valve-sparing aortic root remodeling. The sinuses of Valsalva are replaced with graft material while preserving the native valve, but without reimplanting the valve inside a tube graft (unlike David).
