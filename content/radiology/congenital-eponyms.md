# Congenital Heart Disease Eponyms

## Surgeries

- **Blalock-Taussig-Thomas Shunt (Classic)** — Subclavian artery divided and anastomosed directly end-to-side to the ipsilateral pulmonary artery to augment pulmonary blood flow. Sacrifices the subclavian artery; rarely performed today.
- **Blalock-Taussig-Thomas Shunt (Modified)** — Gore-Tex graft interposed between the subclavian or innominate artery and the pulmonary artery. Preserves native vessels, allows better size control, and easier takedown. Standard approach today.
- **Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) Procedure** — Anastomosis of the proximal main pulmonary artery to the ascending aorta, used to bypass subaortic obstruction while maintaining systemic output. Incorporated as a component of the Norwood, but can also be performed independently in other single ventricle patients with subaortic obstruction.
- **Fontan Procedure** — Final stage of single ventricle palliation directing IVC flow to the pulmonary arteries, completing total cavopulmonary connection.
- **Glenn Shunt (Bidirectional Glenn)** — Superior cavopulmonary anastomosis connecting the SVC directly to the pulmonary arteries, typically performed as stage 2 single ventricle palliation.
- **Jatene Procedure (Arterial Switch Operation)** — Definitive repair for D-TGA involving transection and switching of the great arteries with coronary reimplantation. Restores normal physiology with the morphologic LV as systemic ventricle.
- **Kawashima Procedure** — Technically similar to the bidirectional Glenn, but performed in patients with interrupted IVC and azygos continuation. Because lower body venous blood drains to the SVC, redirecting SVC flow to the lungs diverts a larger fraction of systemic venous return compared to a standard Glenn, resulting in less hypoxia.
- **Konno Procedure** — Aortoventriculoplasty that enlarges the LVOT and aortic annulus by incising the ventricular septum, allowing placement of a larger aortic valve.
- **LeCompte Maneuver** — Technique performed during the Jatene procedure, bringing the PA bifurcation anterior to the neo-aorta by draping the branch PAs around the ascending aorta. Prevents tension and kinking on the pulmonary anastomosis; standard component of modern arterial switch operations.
- **Mee Shunt (Melbourne Shunt)** — Central shunt using a Gore-Tex graft from the ascending aorta to the MPA or PA confluence. Provides more balanced bilateral pulmonary blood flow compared to BTT, and easier takedown than historical direct central shunts (Waterston, Potts).
- **Morrow Myectomy** — Septal myectomy excising hypertrophied interventricular septum to relieve LVOT obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The classic Morrow involved a limited 2–3 cm basal septal resection; modern extended myectomy uses a larger 5–6 cm incision extending distally toward the apex, often combined with mitral valve repair to address SAM-related mitral regurgitation.
- **Mustard Procedure** — Atrial switch for D-TGA using a pericardial or synthetic baffle to redirect venous return at the atrial level. Functionally equivalent to Senning but uses prosthetic material rather than native atrial tissue. Leaves morphologic RV as systemic ventricle (physiologically equivalent to ccTGA). Largely supplanted by Jatene.
- **Nikaidoh Procedure** — Aortic translocation for TGA with VSD and pulmonary stenosis, moving the aortic root posteriorly over the LV with VSD closure.
- **Norwood Procedure** — Stage 1 single ventricle palliation, classically for HLHS but applicable to any single ventricle physiology with systemic outflow obstruction and arch hypoplasia. Consists of: (1) DKS anastomosis of the proximal MPA to the ascending aorta, (2) aortic arch reconstruction/augmentation with homograft, (3) atrial septectomy, and (4) establishment of pulmonary blood flow via shunt (BTT or Sano).
- **Potts Shunt** — Historical systemic-to-pulmonary shunt directly connecting the descending aorta to the left pulmonary artery (rarely used due to difficult takedown).
- **Rastelli Procedure** — Biventricular repair for TGA with VSD and pulmonary stenosis. An intracardiac baffle directs LV outflow through the VSD to the aorta, and a valved conduit (typically homograft or bioprosthetic) connects the RV to the PA, bypassing the obstructed native RVOT. The valved conduit prevents chronic PR and RV volume overload. Conduit replacement is expected as the patient outgrows it.
- **REV Procedure (Réparation à l'Etage Ventriculaire)** — Alternative to Rastelli for TGA with VSD and pulmonary stenosis. Incorporates an arterial switch (Jatene) with LeCompte maneuver, VSD baffling, and resection of the obstructive infundibular septum with direct PA-to-RV anastomosis. Avoids an RV-to-PA conduit, reducing need for reoperation.
- **Ross Procedure** — Pulmonary autograft replacement of the aortic valve, with a homograft placed in the pulmonary position.
- **Ross-Konno Procedure** — Combines the Ross (pulmonary autograft) with the Konno (aortoventriculoplasty) for patients requiring both aortic valve replacement and LVOT/annular enlargement. Often used in pediatric patients with congenital aortic stenosis and a hypoplastic annulus, as the autograft can grow with the child.
- **Sano Shunt** — Non-valved RV-to-PA conduit used as an alternative to the BTT shunt in Norwood stage 1 palliation. Provides better diastolic coronary perfusion (no aortic runoff) compared to BTT, but requires ventriculotomy and has diastolic regurgitation into the RV.
- **Senning Procedure** — Atrial switch for D-TGA using native atrial tissue flaps to redirect venous return. Functionally equivalent to Mustard but avoids prosthetic material. Leaves morphologic RV as systemic ventricle (physiologically equivalent to ccTGA). Largely supplanted by Jatene.
- **Warden Procedure** — Repair for partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (especially high SVC type) by reimplanting the SVC to the right atrial appendage and baffling the anomalous veins.
- **Waterston Shunt** — Historical systemic-to-pulmonary shunt connecting the ascending aorta to the right pulmonary artery (largely abandoned due to complications).

## Pathologies

- **Bland-White-Garland Syndrome (ALCAPA)** — Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, causing myocardial ischemia as pulmonary pressures fall after birth.
- **DiGeorge Syndrome (22q11.2 Deletion)** — Microdeletion syndrome remembered by the CATCH-22 mnemonic:
  - **C**ardiac defects (conotruncal: TOF, truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch)
  - **A**bnormal facies
  - **T**hymic hypoplasia
  - **C**left palate
  - **H**ypocalcemia
  - **22**: chromosome 22
- **Ebstein's Anomaly** — Apical displacement of the septal and posterior tricuspid valve leaflets into the RV, causing atrialization of the right ventricle and tricuspid regurgitation.
- **Eisenmenger Syndrome** — Reversal of a left-to-right shunt due to progressive pulmonary vascular disease, resulting in cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension.
- **Gerbode Defect** — Left ventricular to right atrial communication, either congenital or acquired, causing a left-to-right shunt.
  - Type 1 (direct/supravalvular): defect in the AV membranous septum above the tricuspid valve
  - Type 2 (indirect/infravalvular): perimembranous VSD with tricuspid valve abnormality allowing shunt through the valve
  - Type 3: combined direct and indirect components
- **Holt-Oram Syndrome** — Autosomal dominant condition with upper limb defects (typically radial ray anomalies) and congenital heart defects, most commonly ASD or VSD.
- **Loeys-Dietz Syndrome** — TGF-β pathway mutations causing connective tissue disorder with aortic root aneurysms, arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula; more aggressive vascular disease than Marfan syndrome.
- **Lutembacher Syndrome** — Combination of ASD (typically secundum) with mitral stenosis (congenital or rheumatic), causing altered shunt hemodynamics.
- **Marfan Syndrome** — FBN1 (fibrillin-1) mutation causing connective tissue disorder with aortic root dilation, mitral valve prolapse, lens dislocation, and skeletal abnormalities.
- **Noonan Syndrome** — RASopathy associated with pulmonary valve stenosis (dysplastic valve), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ASD, VSD, and lymphatic abnormalities.
- **Pentalogy of Fallot** — Tetralogy of Fallot plus an ASD (or PFO), adding an additional potential site of shunting.
- **Scimitar Syndrome** — Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return from the right lung to the IVC, with ipsilateral lung hypoplasia and characteristic curvilinear radiographic shadow.
- **Shone Complex** — Multiple left heart obstructive lesions including supravalvar mitral ring, parachute mitral valve, subaortic stenosis, and coarctation.
- **Taussig-Bing Anomaly** — DORV with subpulmonary VSD and side-by-side great arteries, functionally similar to TGA with VSD.
- **Tetralogy of Fallot** — VSD, overriding aorta, pulmonary stenosis, and RV hypertrophy resulting from anterocephalad deviation of the outlet septum.
- **Turner Syndrome** — 45,X karyotype associated with bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and aortic dilation.
- **Uhl's Anomaly** — Near-complete absence of the RV myocardium with parchment-thin wall, distinct from arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy.
- **Williams Syndrome** — 7q11.23 microdeletion (including elastin gene) causing supravalvar aortic stenosis and peripheral pulmonary stenosis.
- **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome** — Accessory pathway causing ventricular pre-excitation; associated with Ebstein's anomaly and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
